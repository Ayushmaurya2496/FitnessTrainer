## Detailed Implementation Plans ðŸ“‹

### Exercise Library Implementation

#### Database Schema Updates
```javascript
// Exercise Model
{
  name: String,
  category: String, // 'strength', 'cardio', 'flexibility', 'yoga'
  difficulty: Number, // 1-5 scale
  description: String,
  instructions: [String],
  targetMuscles: [String],
  equipment: [String],
  duration: Number, // in seconds
  calories: Number, // estimated per session
  videoUrl: String,
  imageUrl: String,
  posePoints: [Object] // Required body landmarks for detection
}

// Workout Template Model
{
  name: String,
  description: String,
  exercises: [{
    exerciseId: ObjectId,
    sets: Number,
    reps: Number,
    duration: Number,
    restTime: Number
  }],
  totalDuration: Number,
  difficulty: Number,
  category: String
}
```

#### API Endpoints to Add
```javascript
// Exercise Management
GET /api/exercises - Fetch all exercises
GET /api/exercises/:category - Get exercises by category
POST /api/exercises - Create new exercise (admin)
PUT /api/exercises/:id - Update exercise (admin)
DELETE /api/exercises/:id - Delete exercise (admin)

// Workout Templates
GET /api/workouts - Get workout templates
GET /api/workouts/:id - Get specific workout
POST /api/workouts/custom - Create custom workout
POST /api/workouts/:id/start - Start workout session
POST /api/workouts/session/end - End workout session
```

### Rep Counting Implementation

#### Computer Vision Enhancement
```javascript
// Enhanced pose detection for specific exercises
class ExerciseDetector {
  detectPushUp(landmarks) {
    // Analyze shoulder, elbow, and hip alignment
    // Calculate angle changes for rep counting
    // Return rep count and form feedback
  }
  
  detectSquat(landmarks) {
    // Monitor hip and knee angles
    // Track depth and form quality
    // Provide real-time corrections
  }
  
  detectPlank(landmarks) {
    // Check body alignment
    // Monitor hold duration
    // Detect form deterioration
  }
}
```

#### Frontend Updates
```javascript
// Real-time rep counter component
class RepCounter {
  constructor(exerciseType) {
    this.exerciseType = exerciseType;
    this.repCount = 0;
    this.isInPosition = false;
    this.formScore = 100;
  }
  
  processFrame(landmarks) {
    const detection = this.analyzeExercise(landmarks);
    this.updateRepCount(detection);
    this.updateFormFeedback(detection);
    this.displayMetrics();
  }
}
```

### User Analytics Dashboard

#### Chart Integration
```javascript
// Progress visualization using Chart.js
const progressChart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: dates,
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Workout Accuracy',
      data: accuracyScores,
      borderColor: '#4f8cff',
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(79, 140, 255, 0.1)'
    }]
  }
});
```

#### Goal Tracking System
```javascript
// Goal model and tracking
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  goalType: String, // 'weight_loss', 'strength', 'endurance'
  targetValue: Number,
  currentValue: Number,
  targetDate: Date,
  isActive: Boolean,
  milestones: [{
    value: Number,
    achievedDate: Date,
    description: String
  }]
}
```
